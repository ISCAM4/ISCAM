visual discrimination task, and the other group was permitted unrestricted sleep on that first night. Both
groups were allowed unrestricted sleep on the following two nights, and then were re-tested on the third
day. Subjects’ performance on the test was recorded as the minimum time (in milliseconds) between
stimuli appearing on a computer screen for which they could accurately report what they had seen on the

following day, but it was not clear how long these negative effects would last. The data presented here
are the improvements in reaction times (in milliseconds), so a negative value indicates a decrease in
performance."><meta property="og:description" content="Researchers have established that sleep deprivation has a harmful effect on visual learning (the subject
