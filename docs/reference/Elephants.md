# Elephant Walking Data

Researchers Holdgate et al. (2016) studied walking behavior of elephants
in North American zoos to see whether there is a difference in average
distance traveled by African and Asian elephants in captivity. They put
GPS loggers on 33 African elephants and 23 Asian elephants, and measured
the distance (in kilometers) the elephants walked per day.
