```r
# uncomment and run this line *once* to install the package
install.packages("ISCAM")

# the following loads the package. You need to do this every time you want to use ISCAM functions
library(ISCAM)
```

This package collates and presents functions for ISCAM alongside some data to be used alongside the textbook.

If you don't know how a function e.g. `EXAMPLE()` works, you can write `?EXAMPLE` in the console to get help. You can also find it on [the website](https://iscam4.github.io/ISCAM/reference/index.html). Also look to the textbook/Canvas/homework to see how the function is used.

You can load the workspace by running

```r
load(url("http://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam4/ISCAM.RData"))
```
