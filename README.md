To use this package alongside your textbook, run `install.packages("ISCAM")` to install the pacakge, and `library(ISCAM)` to load it. Once you've done this, you can access ISCAM functions, all of which start with `ISCAM.` (eg `ISCAM.summary()` or `ISCAM.boxplot()`). You will also have acess to a few datasets, such as `Elephants` and `CloudSeeding`.
